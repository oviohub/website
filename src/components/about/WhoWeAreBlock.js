    aboutMe: (
      <span>
        After receiving a Master of Arts in Conflict, Security and Development from Sussex University, I started my
        career as a project manager for multiple social impact organizations around the world such as United Nations.
        <br />
        When I moved to San Francisco, I was shocked by local nonprofits struggling to leverage technology solutions.
        That is why I decided to co-create Ovio, a tech volunteering platform. I am most passionate about refugee rights
        and womenâ€™s rights. My appetite for social justice oriented my career towards humanitarian and
        social activities.

    aboutMe: (
      <span>
        After a Master of Science in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, I started my career as
        a software engineer in Silicon Valley. My desire to code for good led me to work for a tech nonprofit, Bayes
        Impact.
        <br />
        <br />
        Witnessing the huge need for technology in the social impact sector, I decided to co-create Ovio. I am
        passionate about climate change and human rights. Since graduate school, I have engaged my time and skills to
        support these causes.

    aboutMe: (
      <span>
        I am a data scientist and software engineer with experience working on web engineering and design, embedded
        systems platform architecture and machine learning.
        <br />
        <br />
        After studying Physics, Mechanical Engineering (with a focus on adaptive control theory) and Computer Science
        at Dartmouth College, I spent the next 9 years in a variety of software and analyst positions, ranging from
        programming smart HVAC systems for high performance homes to developing data pipelines, storage and tools for
        an education startup working with satellites. I love mountains and spend most of my free time skiing, rock
        climbing and mountain biking.
